**Goat Image Dataset** is a dataset for object detection and classification tasks. It is used in the livestock industry, and in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 1767 images with 13761 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *face*, *ear*, *eye*, and other: *mouth*.

Images in the Goat Image dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 87 (5% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *dataset_1* (1680 images) and *dataset_2* (87 images). Additionally, every image in *dataset_2* contains information about ***goat_id***. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Northwest A&F University, China.
